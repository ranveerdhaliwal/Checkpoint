# CHECKPOINT

Work in progress app that I'm developing to track backlog and current progress in various games.

I'm using the Giant Bomb API (https://www.giantbomb.com/api) to search for games

I'm also using a variety of libraries with the major ones including: React, Redux, Redux-thunk, Axios, Material-UI, Styled-components, React Router v4, and Enzyme/Jest.

## Instructions

Get your own personal API key from Giant bomb and add it to an .env file in /server

To start the server, go to the /server folder and simply run:

### `yarn start`

To start the client, go to the /client folder and simply run:

### `yarn start`
