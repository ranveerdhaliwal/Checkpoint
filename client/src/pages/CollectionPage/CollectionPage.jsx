Are you crazy? I can't swallow that.
Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life. And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!

Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon. Yes! In your face, Gandhi! It must be wonderful. Oh right. I forgot about the battle.

Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way?
Bender, we're trying our best. Bender, quit destroying the universe! Moving along… No argument here. Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume?

She also liked to shut up!
I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.
Professor, make a woman out of me.
The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep.
Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry? I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared… Okay, I like a challenge. How much did you make me?

Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men.
I never loved you.
Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here.
I never loved you. Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs? Daylight and everything. It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. Is that a cooking show? Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it?

Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans! Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression!

I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money. You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! Hey, guess what you're accessories to.

Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory. Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. No, just a regular mistake.

Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal? My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.

And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans! I'm a thing. You wouldn't. Ask anyway!
